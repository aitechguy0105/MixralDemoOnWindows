# Mixtral Demo

## Project Description

This project is a demo of Mixtral, a sentiment analysis model, implemented on the Windows platform using Visual Studio 2022. The project is developed in C++ and utilizes the llama.cpp framework for inference with the Mixtral 8x7b Instructor 1.0 model. The main technique employed in this project is model quantization, and the primary function of the application is sentiment analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio 2022
- **Language:** C++
- **Framework:** llama.cpp
- **Model:** Mixtral 8x7b Instructor 1.0
- **Technique:** Model quantization, C++ inference
- **Platform:** Windows

## Project Structure

The project contains the necessary source code, configuration files, and dependencies for implementing the sentiment analysis functionality using the Mixtral model. The codebase is organized to facilitate model inference and interaction with the sentiment analysis functionality.

## Setup and Usage

To set up and run the Mixtral Demo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Build and compile the project to generate the executable.
4. Run the executable to launch the Mixtral Demo application.
5. Input the text or data for sentiment analysis and observe the results generated by the Mixtral model.



## Acknowledgments

We acknowledge the developers and contributors of the llama.cpp framework and the Mixtral 8x7b Instructor 1.0 model for their valuable contributions to this project.
